# Site Search

A Ruby on Rails app for the external site search on the City of Malmo and the intranet. Search recommendations are managed in the application. The [siteseeker_normalizer](https://github.com/malmostad/siteseeker_normalizer) Ruby Gem is used for the Siteseeker integration part.

## Dependencies
* nginx (for production)
* Ruby 2.x
* MySQL or PostgreSQL
* ElasticSearch 1.4
* Memcached

## Development Setup

Dependencies:

* Vagrant
* A Vagrant compatible virtual machine such as VirtualBox or VMWare

To provision the Vagrant box, run the following command in the root of the project on the host (compiling Ruby will take time):

```shell
$ vagrant up
```

Check `install_info.txt` in project root when the provisioning has finished.

To log in to the box:

```shell
$ vagrant ssh
```

Start the application in the Vagrant box:

```shell
$ cd /vagrant
$ rails s -b 0.0.0.0
```

You should now be able to access the server on your host system at http://127.0.0.1:3030


## Server Setup

A bootstrap script and a standalone Puppet (no master) are used to provision a fresh server running Ubuntu 14.04. Do not run the provisioning on an existing server if you have made manual changes to config files generated by Puppet.

The Puppet setup is based on assumptions about common configurations we use for servers. `server.pp` initiate the Puppet module [mcommons](https://github.com/malmostad/puppet-mcommons) which contains wrappers around third-party Puppet modules.

1. Add `app_runner` as a sudo user on the server.
2. Download the provisioning files:

        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malmostad/sitesearch/master/puppet/bootstrap.sh
        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malmostad/sitesearch/master/puppet/server.pp

3. Check that the files are OK and start the provisioning (compiling Ruby will take time):

        $ chmod +x ./bootstrap.sh
        $ sudo ./bootstrap.sh

4. When finished, read the generated `install_info.txt` file (it's short) in `app_runner`'s home directory.


## Build and Deployment
Build and deployment is made with Capistrano.

Run the deployment script with one of the following command including the environment name:

```shell
$ bundle exec cap staging_external deploy
$ bundle exec cap staging_internal deploy
$ bundle exec cap production_external deploy
$ bundle exec cap production_internal deploy
```

## Testing
Run tests before pushing to the repository and performing deployments. The application contains high level integration/feature tests and unit tests using RSpec, Capybara and PhantomJS. To run all test cases:

```shell
$ bundle exec rspec
```
Or during development:

```shell
$ bundle exec guard
```
